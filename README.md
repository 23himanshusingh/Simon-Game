A classic Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to mimic a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game, with the sequence getting longer each round. Test your memory and see how far you can go!

Features:-
Randomized sequences of colors and sounds for each round.
Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users.
Visual and sound feedback for user actions and game sequence.
Progressive difficulty, with the sequence getting longer each round.
Strict Mode: An optional feature where one mistake ends the game.

How to Play:-
The game will show a sequence of colors and sounds. Your task is to repeat the sequence in the correct order.
As you progress, the sequence will get longer with each round.
If you make a mistake, the game will either:
Allow you to try again (Normal mode), or
End the game (Strict mode).
Try to achieve the highest score possible by completing as many rounds as you can!

Technologies Used
HTML5 for the structure of the game.
CSS3 for styling and animations.
JQuery for game logic and interactions.
